# rbar
rbar is an x11 status bar
if you want to use this you will have to change some of the code, specifically the audio setup, I normally have 2 sinks, my speakers and my headphones, but this might not exactly be a common setup, so you will have to change that.
The code should be readable/easily changable if you know rust.
